This code creates a 8x8 chessboard using the Tkinter library.

The `Tablero` class inherits from the `Tk` class. The `__init__` method initializes the `Tablero` object. It sets the window size to 640x640 pixels and positions it at 500 pixels from the left and 150 pixels from the top of the screen. It then creates a `Canvas` object and packs it into the window. The `Canvas` object is used to draw the chessboard.

The `cuadrado` method draws the squares on the chessboard. It iterates over the rows and columns of the chessboard. For each square, it checks if the sum of the row and column numbers is even. If it is, the square is drawn in red. Otherwise, it is drawn in black.

The `main` function creates an instance of the `Tablero` class and calls its `mainloop` method to start the event loop. This will keep the window open until the user closes it.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. The `Tablero` class inherits from the `Tk` class. This means that it has access to all of the methods and properties of the `Tk` class.
2. The `__init__` method initializes the `Tablero` object. It sets the window size, position, and title. It then creates a `Canvas` object and packs it into the window.
3. The `cuadrado` method draws the squares on the chessboard. It iterates over the rows and columns of the chessboard. For each square, it checks if the sum of the row and column numbers is even. If it is, the square is drawn in red. Otherwise, it is drawn in black.
4. The `main` function creates an instance of the `Tablero` class and calls its `mainloop` method to start the event loop. This will keep the window open until the user closes it.
